# Deep-Understanding
A repos with some programs which uses self made deep learning algo's, with rubber ducky like comments (hopefully)


## The Plan
First order of buisness is making a plan for what to implement, remember this is a repository for learning not for reinventing the wheel

So what we want to do is:
* Make functions that are easy to understand (hungarian notation?)
* Implement at least a working fully connected layer
* Implement it in diffrent languages
